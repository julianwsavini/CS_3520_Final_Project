# cs3520_final_project

Hello! We recorded a video that is attached on canvas, so we suggest watching the video first, and hopefully that helps clarify some details about the program.

Additional details:
After 'make clean' and 'make all', you can run the program by typing './System'

We want to emphasize that the most important file to view is users.txt. If you would rather just login to a previously made account, you can do that by viewing this file! This is what the file currently looks like: 

Hello,Goodbye M

Hola,Adios M

FirstOfficer,Password O

SecOffice,PA O

COACH1,COACH1 C

brad,2 M

smerkle,smerk C

In the file, the first word (seperated by comma), is the username, and the second word is the password. After the password is another seperator (a space), and then a letter which represents the user type. So, if you wanted to login as an officer, the accounts tagged with the letter "O" are an officers (For example, username is 'FirstOfficer', password is 'Password'). Accounts ending with letter "C" are coaches (username 'COACH1', password 'COACH1'). Finally, a regular member is tagged with an M (one member has username 'Hola', password 'Goodbye'). 

Hopefully this clarifies your ability to login as different user types. And, once you login, a menu is provided (menu changes depending on user type), and you can type an integer to move to a section in the menu. Hopefully this clarifies anything that may have seemed confusing! And thank you!
